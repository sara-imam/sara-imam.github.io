                      <a href="./img/Report.pdf" target="_blank">| Project Report</a>
                      <p> The use (or lack thereof) of contraceptive methods can be strongly affected by
                        demographic and socio-economic factors. Being able to predict the use from the factors,
                        allows for better marketing or advertising to targeted groups. With this goal, we attempted
                        to be able to predict the use of contraceptives (no use, short term, long term) from looking
                        at certain demographic and socio-economic features. Upon the creation of many models
                        (including LogisticRegression, Cross-Validation, Random Forests, etc) plus analysis to find
                        the most highly correlated features and the addition of hyperparameters, we were able to
                        achieve a training accuracy of 72%. </p>

                    <p> I recreated a board game called "Tablut", based on an ancient Nordic and Celtic strategy board game played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers. In my iteration, you can either play the game through terminal commands, or through a GUI I built. I also created a complex AI, which was designed to force a win within 4 moves if possible for whichever side it played. </p>

                    <p> I recreated the Enigma Machine which was used for encryption during WWII. My project takes a .in text file with a message, and encrypts it given a rotor setting, plug board, alphabet, and ring setting (Ringstellung). It outputs to a .out file. The machine can also take in an output, and decrypt the mesage to the given alphabet. The encryption process follows that of the original machine!</p>

                  <p> I created a mini version control system modeled after git. It supported the following commands: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge, add-remote, push, pull, and delete-remote. I utilized SHA1 serialization for file tracking. </p>

                  <p> I recreated a board game called "Tablut", based on an ancient Nordic and Celtic strategy board game played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers. In my iteration, you can either play the game through terminal commands, or through a GUI I built. I also created a complex AI, which was designed to force a win within 4 moves if possible for whichever side it played. </p>

                  <p> I recreated the Enigma Machine which was used for encryption during WWII. My project takes a .in text file with a message, and encrypts it given a rotor setting, plug board, alphabet, and ring setting (Ringstellung). It outputs to a .out file. The machine can also take in an output, and decrypt the mesage to the given alphabet. The encryption process follows that of the original machine!</p>

                  <p> The use (or lack thereof) of contraceptive methods can be strongly affected by
                    demographic and socio-economic factors. Being able to predict the use from the factors,
                    allows for better marketing or advertising to targeted groups. With this goal, we attempted
                    to be able to predict the use of contraceptives (no use, short term, long term) from looking
                    at certain demographic and socio-economic features. Upon the creation of many models
                    (including LogisticRegression, Cross-Validation, Random Forests, etc) plus analysis to find
                    the most highly correlated features and the addition of hyperparameters, we were able to
